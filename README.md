# Sushma-OpenDNS-Submission
\Implementation of the technical test as per the specifications in the mockups.

I have used the Angular  MVC framework along with jQuery to translate the requirement due to my familiarity with them. 
Used a combination of both inline styles+external style sheet because of simplicity and time constraint. 
I have also included the templates in the index.html file itself(using inline ng-template scripts), to allow for timely submission.
